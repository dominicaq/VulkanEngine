# VulkanEngine
Inside this project are multiple abstractions of what Vulkan does under the hood. My main focus was rendering in the file `vke_renderer` and understanding the rendering pipeline. I implemented a multi light fragment shader, `vke_frame_buffer`, and `shadow_map_system` for real time shadows. The rest of the code was me following a tutorial to understand the Vulkan API.

This project takes `.obj` files only and does not bind textures.
